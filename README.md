***Current Status***

This project is in its infancy, and while it currently supports the following commands:

- ls
- dir
- pwd
- rm
- rmdir
- mv
- vim

Please note that compatibility issues may arise on different hardware and software configurations. This emulator is not yet ready for prime time and should not be relied upon as your primary terminal emulator.
